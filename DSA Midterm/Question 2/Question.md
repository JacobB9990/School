Given a singly linked list of numbers. Starting from the head, consider each
consecutive elements as a group. The leftovers (must be less than ) are considered as a group.
Please design an algorithm to reverse all elements in each group. Your algorithm should be as
efficient as possible in both time and space. And, please analyze the time complexity and space
complexity.

- Example: Given 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 and k = 3. In this example, 1 → 2 → 3
  is a group, 4 → 5 → 6 is another group, 7 → 8 and is the leftover group. The
  output of your algorithm should be. 3 → 2 → 1 → 5 → 5 → 4 → 8 → 7.
