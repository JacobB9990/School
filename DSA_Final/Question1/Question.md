#### Question

1. Given a sequence of tuples, A = [(k_1, v_1), (k_2, v_2), ... , (k_n, v_n)], where each tuple consists of a key k_i and a value v_i, we define a data structure that satisfies the following two conditions:

1. It is a binary tree such that the in-order traversal on the values of the nodes gives the sorted sequence of values.
2. The tree, meanwhile, has the min-heap property on the keys.

This data structure is particularly useful in searching. For example, consider:

A = [(5, 6), (1, 2), (3, 4), (9, 1), (6, 9), (2, 8), (4, 3), (8, 5)]

This data structure looks like the following:

Please design an algorithm, as efficient as possible, to construct this data structure for a given sequence of numbers, and analyze the time complexity.

#### Answer

- To solve this problem, the approach starts by sorting the tuples based on their values (the second element of each tuple). This sorting step ensures that when we later traverse the tree in-order, the values will appear in ascending order, satisfying the first condition. After sorting, the tuples are arranged into a min-heap based on their keys (the first element of each tuple). The min-heap property ensures that each parent nodeâ€™s key is smaller than its child nodes, which satisfies the second condition. The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, and the heap construction takes O(n) time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n log n). This method efficiently constructs the desired binary tree structure, ensuring both sorted values and the heap property are met.
